# BankO-matic   

BankOmatic is a banking bot project built using artificial algorithms that analyze a user's queries and understand a user's message. The system is designed for bank use wherein users can ask  bank-related questions, such as branch locations, ATM locations, the process of opening bank accounts, and bank operating hours. There is no specific format for users to ask questions. The built-in artificial intelligence system understands users requirements and provides suitable answers to the users.
